I have implemented this application in Swift.

I have tried to call the from given url using URLSession class of Swift but its not able to encode in json. 
It gives "The data couldn’t be read because it isn’t in the correct format" exception. So kept that json on bundle of application and read the json from that file.

I have downloaded image from url and displayed it. I have implemented unit case.
